# Experiments and Causality - A 2 x 3 Factorial Design Study Around Analytical Problem Solving Performance

This repository contains a paper completed as part of UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science course "W241 - Experiments and Causality". This study seeks to examine the research question, “Can the use of color and/or the use of questions with context help students improve analytical problem solving performance?”. In order to address this question, a 2 x 3 factorial design with a within-subjects component was utilized. Each subject was asked six unique analytical problem solving questions each with 2 potential color conditions– ‘no color’ or ‘with color’, and 3 potential context conditions– ‘question without context’, ‘question with context’, and ‘question with context and diagram’.
